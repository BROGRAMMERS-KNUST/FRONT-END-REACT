1
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,748
A mutant virus has emerged

2
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,959
in which patients begin
to exhibit symptoms within five minutes

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
in low-pressured environments.

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,174
A much faster pace compared to
previous incubation period of 24 hours.

5
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,635
Raising even greater concerns
in regards to containment.

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,887
After the outbreak,

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,931
the increase of symptoms
like abnormal physical ability

8
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,266
and violent tendencies

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,603
has led the infected
to display animal-like behaviors,

10
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,898
making it difficult
to secure quarantine facilities.

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,652
In the United States, more than
150,000 people have been infected,

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,114
mostly by US forces
returning home from serving in Korea,

13
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,867
and more than 30,000 have died.

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,869
North Korea is on the verge of collapse

15
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,705
with over eight and a half million
reported infected people,

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,583
representing a third
of the country's total population.

17
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,377
By contrast,
South Korea has just been declared

18
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,756
a DMZ Virus-free zone
by the World Health Organization today

19
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,801
when the last known infected person
known only as "Choi"

20
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,761
died after a thirteen-day illness.

21
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:39,557
To date, South Korea
has reported 345 total cases with 34..

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,792
Go.

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,134
MOTEL

24
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,479
Team Two, supporting the site.

25
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,439
Team Three, blocking the exit.

26
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,024
The cause of the DMZ Virus

27
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,852
which was allegedly
first detected in the DMZ,

28
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,981
a symbol of the ceasefire between
North and South Korea, ten months ago,

29
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,941
has not yet been identified.

30
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,361
It has been 19 days since Dr. Jung
and his daughter have disappeared

31
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,946
while on their way to North Korea,

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,866
and there is no information
about their whereabouts.

33
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,743
Dr. Jung became quite famous,

34
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,455
after curing his daughter Ha-na
of the DMZ virus,

35
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,082
drawing the attention
of academics worldwide.

36
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,420
Dr. Jung had been en route to the
Sinuiju Chemical Weapons Institute

37
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,131
in order to mass produce
the antibody treatment,

38
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,551
as was agreed upon
by both North and South Korea,

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,137
when he disappeared
along with his daughter.

40
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
Some organizations accused

41
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,933
the South Korean government
of putting on a show

42
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,769
in order to cripple
the North Korean infrastructure,

43
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:51,981
and warned that demonstrations
demanding the whereabouts of Dr. Jung

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,443
and his daughter,
as well as their return to North Korea,

45
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,654
would take place nationwide.

46
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,348
Opposing organizations
heavily criticized them,

47
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,451
labeling them as pro-North Korean,

48
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,746
accusing them of working
for the North Korean government,

49
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,207
and warned of a counter demonstration.

50
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,417
As a result, police are on high alert

51
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,221
to keep the situation
from getting violent..

52
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,882
Who are you?

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,968
Where is Dr. Jung Byeong-ho?

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,471
Doctor? Who is that person?

55
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,062
Where did you get this?
Where is Dr. Jung Byeong-ho?

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,274
Why are you asking me this?

57
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Watch this.

58
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,165
Dr. Jung is with me at the moment.

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,086
If you come to the Possess Motel
room 605 in Yeongdeungpo market,

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,963
you can meet him.

61
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,467
This is what you sent.

62
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,931
The man in this video

63
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,018
is me?

64
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,014
What have you done
to the back of your head?

65
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,734
Before we blast your head off,
answer me correctly!

66
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,527
I can't remember anything.

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,488
I can't even remember my name.

68
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,060
Whose blood is this?

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,053
Answer the phone.

70
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,680
Answer the phone, now!

71
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,494
Hello?

72
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,248
Your name is Carter.

73
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
"Carter"?

74
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,960
What is "Carter"?

75
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,922
I'd like to speak
with the person behind you.

76
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,551
Could you please put them on the phone?

77
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,352
She'd like to... to speak with you.

78
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,148
Answer.

79
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,613
Who is this?

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,636
We're going to blow up
this room in 20 seconds.

81
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,433
That will lure in
the rest of their forces.

82
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,521
Who are you? How are you talking to me?

83
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,605
What happened?

84
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,108
What the hell is
this guy rambling on about?

85
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,236
There is a device implanted
in your ear.

86
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,156
You are the only one who can hear me.

87
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,744
Jump out of the window
to get to the next building.

88
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,623
Please trust me, if you want to live.

89
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,666
Ten seconds left.

90
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,755
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

91
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,591
six, five...

92
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,623
Carter.

93
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,958
Carter, are you okay?

94
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
What is this place?

95
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,380
What is it
that you're looking at?

96
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,634
- So you're Korean then?
- Is that what matters right now?

97
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,135
Listen to me if you want to live.

98
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,472
Sir, help me. Wait.
These assholes are completely insane.

99
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,351
Don't worry
about the people there,

100
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,353
just get out of that building quickly.

101
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,979
Who are you?

102
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,730
Me?

103
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,151
What, we introducing ourselves now?

104
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,694
I didn't mean you.

105
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,990
When they arrive, you'll die before
you can get your questions answered.

106
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,158
Who are "they"?

107
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,203
Why don't you tell me
who the hell you are first, huh?

108
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,371
CIA.

109
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,707
"CIA"?

110
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,752
CIA? So you're here now,
to save me, right?

111
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,465
- The CIA?
- I thought that I was a goner.

112
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,593
Are we sure we got the right guy?

113
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,928
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

114
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,848
Wait. Come on. Murder these bastards!

115
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,267
Hey, what are you waiting for, huh?

116
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,562
No, that's not me.

117
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,726
Hold him!

118
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,688
Kill!

119
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,464
Yah!

120
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,597
- Over there!
- Kill him!

121
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,351
Over there!

122
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,146
- He's going down!
- Get him!

123
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,495
Hyah!

124
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,122
Hyah!

125
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,464
There he is! Get him! We want him alive!

126
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,217
The market is right in front
of you. Go in that direction.

127
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,431
The other side!

128
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,017
Go out the other side
of the market and turn left.

129
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,357
What in the world...

130
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,061
Someone's on my tail.

131
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,883
50 meters in front of you,
you'll see a Papa John's motorcycle.

132
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,325
Use it to escape.

133
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,702
Stop that man!

134
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,912
He's getting on a bike!

135
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,164
Stop him! Stop him! Cut him off!

136
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,584
Move!

137
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,128
He's going down! Get him!

138
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,403
Carter. Go to
the back door of the clothing shop.

139
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,267
Call the police!
Please, please, come on, hurry.

140
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,728
- Come on, hurry. Please.
- What do I say?

141
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,857
Yes, I'm at a clothing store.

142
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,527
A strange man...

143
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,924
You'll find a staircase

144
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,164
at the end of the left passage.
Go upstairs.

145
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,609
How do you know all this?

146
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,587
I can get
the security camera information

147
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,187
and the blind spots from your earpiece,

148
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,756
which can detect heat signatures
in your fifty-meter radius.

149
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,978
Carter!

150
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,272
A target with a CIA frequency
is approaching.

151
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,359
Eliminate him
and secure his device.

152
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,897
The CIA is all over the place.
Hide somewhere, now.

153
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,446
Secure the device on his wrist.

154
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,489
We're going to backtrace their hideout.

155
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,202
"Backtrace"?

156
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,566
There's a car approaching
at the end of the alley.

157
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,623
Get in the car and hand over the device.

158
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,875
Tell me why the CIA is chasing me.

159
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,127
There's a lethal bomb
planted in your mouth.

160
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,630
It has blast radius of ten meters.

161
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,886
If you refuse to work with us,
it will activate.

162
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,639
License plate 4566.

163
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,099
Your questions will be answered
once you get into the car.

164
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,185
And why would I get in that car?

165
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,268
Tell me, now.

166
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,396
Then you give us no choice.

167
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
You must be terminated.

168
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,819
I have the detonator here in my hand.

169
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,495
The car is approaching.
Move it. And hurry.

170
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,757
Is Hye-won doing well in class?

171
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,013
DAEHAN TAEKWONDO

172
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,939
- Drive! Drive!
- Over there!

173
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,153
You have the device?

174
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,245
- Hack it.
- Right. I'll start tracing them.

175
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,833
Choi Yu-jin, NIS.
Strategic relations with North Korea.

176
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,629
And the woman talking in my ear,
she on your side?

177
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm Han Jung Hee.

178
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,804
I work for
the International Liaison Department

179
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,259
of the Labor Party in North Korea.

180
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,471
We are currently working with South Korea
to create a treatment for the DMZ Virus.

181
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,270
These are North Koreans
who have been infected by the DMZ Virus.

182
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,356
The infected
are overwhelmingly strong and violent.

183
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,985
Some have been discovered
to even be able to use tools or weapons.

184
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,947
All of South Korea's army is at the DMZ,
holding off the infected,

185
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,991
but every day is precarious.

186
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,672
In North Korea,
we have secured

187
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,747
a hundred million anthrax vaccines
needed to produce the treatment,

188
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,790
as well as a large scale assembly line,

189
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,960
so that Dr. Jung's research
can be carried out smoothly.

190
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,879
That's the reason we tried to bring

191
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,589
Dr. Jung and his daughter, Jung Ha-na,

192
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,008
to the North
for the completion of the project.

193
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,510
Daughter?

194
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,346
Dr. Jung's daughter was infected

195
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,931
by a field rat
while they were living out in Paju.

196
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,184
He was able to cure his own daughter,

197
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,187
and started studying her antibodies
to find a treatment.

198
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,901
However, due to an abnormal increase
in thromboplastin,

199
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,612
an enzyme that coagulates blood
once it leaves the body,

200
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,655
her antibodies were
destroyed in seconds.

201
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,533
That's why we were heading to
the Sinuiju Chemical Weapons Institute,

202
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,785
for Ha-na's blood.

203
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,428
However, Ha-na was kidnapped
on her way to North Korea

204
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,624
by an agent from A9,
a secret organization in the CIA.

205
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,668
Your mission is to find Ha-na
and bring her to North Korea.

206
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
You're the one who
suggested this mission.

207
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,963
It was your idea.

208
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,424
Why would I?

209
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,803
You commanded us to
block the memory center in your brain.

210
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
Am I your commander?

211
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,304
I suppose you'll return
to your position

212
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,766
after the mission is finished.

213
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,813
Why would I erase my memory,
and give up my rank?

214
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,440
You used to be
a CIA agent from South Korea,

215
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,568
but you disguised yourself as a reporter
and entered North Korea.

216
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,489
You became a hero to our people.
You were a hero to South Korea.

217
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:32,119
However, the North Korean government was
suspicious that you were an American spy

218
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,871
and assigned a woman
to keep a close eye on you.

219
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,625
The two of you fell in love,
and even got married.

220
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,836
And then, you had a daughter.

221
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,505
This woman and I?

222
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,299
But your wife died
from the DMZ Virus,

223
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,635
and your daughter, Yoon Hee,
also got infected

224
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,847
and is now imprisoned
in the research facility in Sinuiju.

225
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,853
This is a good shot.

226
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,688
Look over here.

227
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,440
Yoon Hee.

228
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,657
Yoon Hee!

229
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,662
Dad? Dad?

230
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,165
Dad...

231
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,667
- ...Dad.
- Yoon Hee.

232
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,048
That scar
on the back of your hand

233
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,301
is from the burn that
you got that night.

234
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,972
The weapons you need
for the infiltration are in here.

235
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,101
Now you can do what Han Jung Hee says
until the assignment is complete.

236
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,853
You need to save Ha-na

237
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,022
so that your daughter,

238
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,523
Lee Yun Hui, might live.

239
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,700
Go to the rooftop.

240
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,078
Ha-na is being held in the building
across from this one.

241
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,797
Check the weapons in the bag
and put them on.

242
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,187
We must move Ha-na today
if we want to save your daughter's life.

243
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
She doesn't have much time left.

244
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,611
The majority of those infected
die just under 13 days.

245
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,990
Today is the 13th day
since your daughter was infected.

246
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,124
How do I know
that child is really my daughter?

247
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,876
When you
get your memory back,

248
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,670
and your daughter is dead,

249
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,339
who will you blame?

250
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,739
Go through the door to your right
and move to the edge of the rooftop.

251
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,708
I've hacked the communication channels
of the CIA agents in the building.

252
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,499
I'm getting their whereabouts now.

253
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,862
Negative, sir.

254
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,546
We're still working on establishing
the identity of the subject.

255
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,174
Bullshit! Get the geeks
at Langley on it if you have to.

256
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092
I can't do shit

257
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,886
until we have actual evidence
that the North is on the move.

258
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,016
The agents are gathered in
the motel you were in. Now is the chance.

259
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,172
FLORAL SUPPLIES WHOLESALE MARKET

260
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,449
The elevator control room is
through the door in front of you.

261
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,807
Move toward it.

262
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,781
I'm detecting the heat signature
of one adult

263
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,368
near the elevator on the ninth floor
and two on the seventh floor.

264
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,036
This mall looks out of business.

265
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,999
It's the perfect place
for the CIA to set up a temporary base.

266
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,209
The agents that were sent to the motel
are on their way back. Hurry.

267
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,585
And Ha-na?

268
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,587
I'm detecting
the heat signature.

269
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm detecting her on the sixth floor.

270
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,138
Ha-na will be in the playroom
once you go through the emergency exit.

271
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,122
The heat signatures
near the entrance are targets.

272
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,457
EMERGENCY EXIT

273
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,776
Who are you? Why are you here?

274
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,406
Stay back! Stay away from me!

275
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,285
Ha-na? You're Ha-na, right?

276
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,203
- Listen, I'm..
- Stay back I said!

277
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
What should I do?

278
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,423
Hand her the phone.

279
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,020
Here, answer it.

280
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,190
I'll stay over here. Hmm?

281
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,122
Um, hello?

282
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,751
Dad? Dad, please, where are you?

283
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,129
Yeah.

284
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,965
Yeah.

285
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,176
Okay.

286
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,559
Dad, can I trust this man?

287
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,937
Okay.

288
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,274
Okay, I'll do that.

289
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Okay.

290
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,330
Are you all right?

291
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,458
- Yes.
- Let's go find your dad.

292
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,170
How though? How do we get out of here?

293
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,895
Get back! Get back!

294
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,412
You are a hard man to find, Mr. Lee.

295
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,374
Carter Lee.

296
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,503
That is your name, isn't it?

297
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,509
Oh, we're playing that game now.

298
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,677
That's fine.

299
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,182
Fortunately for us, I have a shit-ton
of computer geeks back at Langley

300
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,769
who get a boner whenever I ask
them to dig up some shit on people.

301
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,605
Between you and me,

302
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,109
they're probably a bunch
of introverted perverts who

303
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,320
couldn't do four push-ups
to save their life. But, uh,

304
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,156
they get the job done. So, you know,

305
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,283
what are you gonna to do?

306
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,956
All right, let's see here.

307
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:26,045
"Carter Lee. Born in 1986.
Jamsil, South Korea."

308
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,590
"Immigrated to New York at age 11."

309
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,468
Blah, blah, blah.

310
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,804
Some more boring shit.

311
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,764
Oh, damn!

312
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,476
You went to Sornell?

313
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,770
My cousin went there!

314
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,064
Yeah!

315
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,691
He was a real piece of shit.

316
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,153
Oh, okay, here we go.

317
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:55,283
2014, you traveled to North Korea
as a journalist and, uh...

318
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,284
What?

319
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,164
You become
a naturalized citizen of the DPRK?

320
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,208
Oh!

321
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,794
I bet it was
all of that socialist bullshit

322
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,796
they taught you back at Sornell.

323
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,548
Am I right? Huh?

324
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,843
A real hero of the people.

325
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,926
Yeah.

326
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,473
So,
here's the thing I don't understand,

327
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,184
and, uh, maybe you can help me out this.

328
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,647
What the fuck
are you doing back in South Korea?

329
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,941
And more importantly,

330
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,571
why are you fucking up my shit?

331
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,411
All right.

332
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,039
So check this out, man. I...

333
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,168
I actually don't give a fuck about you.
I.. I really don't.

334
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,838
Just tell me who you're working for.

335
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,342
And, uh... we'll call it a day.

336
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,967
Huh?

337
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,303
Is it the North?

338
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,473
Is it the South?

339
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,395
Come on. You can tell Smith Hyeong.

340
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,193
The North or the South.
What does it matter?

341
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,987
Oh, shit.

342
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,532
You can talk!

343
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, continue.

344
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,622
At least they aren't the ones
watching people die from the virus.

345
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,707
And treating it as an opportunity.

346
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,294
So you're saying
the United States...

347
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,174
You think those 300,000
pissed off Koreans out there,

348
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,634
feel the same way?

349
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,470
I don't know,
I think they're pretty convinced

350
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,599
that this is all a fabricated scheme
formed by the South Korean government!

351
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,725
"Fabricated"?

352
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,895
Didn't you create that rumor
to incite a riot?

353
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,771
"Rumor"?

354
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,233
Us?

355
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,739
Oh, wow.

356
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,283
Carter.

357
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,829
The things they led you to believe...

358
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,791
Have you ever considered the possibility

359
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,084
that it could be

360
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
even more blinding

361
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,964
of the truth?

362
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,842
The real truth?

363
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,510
Sir!

364
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,431
What is it?

365
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,558
The CCTV results came in.

366
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,270
The movement of Carter Lee matches
that of former CIA Agent Michael Bane

367
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,813
by 87%.

368
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,274
Michael Bane...

369
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,237
Wasn't he KIA in Syria
in your last deployment together?

370
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,071
Yes, sir.

371
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,908
They told us he was dead,

372
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,452
but none of us had
actual eyes on his remains.

373
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,929
The fuck are you doing?

374
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,890
BD-7...

375
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,560
That's how
they successfully wiped his memory.

376
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,479
Maybe.

377
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,193
But I don't think they fully
reconstructed the new one quite yet.

378
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,446
The eyes...

379
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,241
You can change the face,

380
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,451
but not the eyes.

381
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,496
And they never lie.

382
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,794
Is this why you rushed back to Korea?

383
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,050
We'll have the answers
once we've run the DNA lab, sir.

384
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,305
The commies are getting cute.

385
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,682
Run it.

386
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,350
Sir.

387
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,605
What the hell's going on?

388
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,857
Hang tight, hero.

389
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,775
Who knows?

390
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,698
Maybe the results will tell me
that you're not as useless as I thought.

391
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,080
Sir! There's a signal
coming from the subject's body.

392
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,120
Scan it.

393
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,003
Carter!
I need to cut communication

394
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,373
from your ear piece for a moment

395
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,250
and use the signal in your molar
as a decoy.

396
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,673
Picking up a strange signal
coming from his molar, sir.

397
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,884
What the fuck are you waiting on?
Take it out!

398
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,638
Get off me! Get off!

399
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,350
Just open your mouth.

400
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,065
The molar will detonate in five seconds.

401
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,848
Get on my back.

402
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,105
Hold tightly onto me.

403
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,925
Ha-na!

404
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,929
- Mister, help!
- Ha-na, hang on just a second!

405
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,995
Mister, help!

406
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,341
Are you okay?

407
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,759
Yes, I'm okay.

408
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,387
Hey, are you all right?

409
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,242
What are you doing? This is my work van..

410
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,102
- Go, go, go!
- He's taking off!

411
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:49,989
Get him!

412
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,977
Repatriate
Dr. Jung to North Korea!

413
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,563
Repatriate! Repatriate!

414
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,610
We know
the US is behind all this!

415
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,570
We know! We know!

416
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,824
Repatriate
Dr. Jung to North Korea!

417
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,244
Repatriate! Repatriate!

418
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,330
We know
the US is behind all this!

419
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,707
We know! We know!

420
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,836
Repatriate
Dr. Jung to North Korea!

421
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,047
Repatriate! Repatriate!

422
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,383
Ha-na, what's wrong?

423
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,469
We know! We know!

424
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,179
Ha-na! Ha-na!

425
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,263
Dad.

426
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,598
Dad!

427
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,352
To North Korea!
To North Korea!

428
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,647
Dad!

429
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,983
We know! We know!

430
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,066
Dad!

431
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,449
Ha-na.

432
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,869
Do you know how worried I've been?

433
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,914
Where have you been?

434
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,017
- Huh?
- Ha-na. What's wrong?

435
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,644
We know! We know!

436
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,062
My dad is over there...

437
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,357
But that's not me.
He's with some other girl...

438
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,443
Repatriate! Repatriate!

439
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,696
We know
the US is behind all this!

440
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,573
We know! We know!

441
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,701
But why are people wearing masks
of me and my dad?

442
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,413
Repatriate! Repatriate!

443
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,333
Well, it's because
they want you to stay safe.

444
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,960
We know! We know!

445
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,631
Should we put them on too?

446
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,217
Repatriate! Repatriate!

447
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,596
We know
the US is behind all this!

448
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,848
We know! We know!

449
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,815
We bring you breaking news.

450
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,318
Dr. Jung,
who had been missing until now,

451
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,904
has been confirmed to be in Sinuiju.

452
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,491
We've just received a video
showing Dr. Jung himself.

453
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,701
Let us take a look.

454
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,789
Hello. I am Jung Byeong-ho.

455
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,125
And I have arrived safely to Sinuiju,

456
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,379
thanks to the North
and South Korean governments.

457
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,007
I have also spoken to my daughter
on the phone moments ago

458
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,803
and I plan to start developing a cure
as soon as possible...

459
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,471
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH JUNG BYEONG-HO

460
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,182
once I make it to
the Sinuiju Institute as planned.

461
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:49,687
Also, I have heard rumors
that the South Korean government

462
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,690
is attempting to destroy the North
right now.

463
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,402
However, I assure you it is not true.

464
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,029
Please do not be misled.

465
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,200
That was a video of
Dr. Jung sent directly from Sinuiju.

466
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:07,413
We will be reporting the rest on our
regular scheduled news. Thank you.

467
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,412
This should be good enough.

468
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,498
One year anniversary song.

469
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,792
Three, two, one.

470
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,335
- No! He can't.
- What?

471
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,880
- You're terrible at writing songs.
- Yeah, I can't.

472
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,797
Wait, try again...

473
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,300
Carter, why did you stop?

474
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,386
Ha-na is a little tired.

475
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
- I'm fine..
- Shh.

476
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,183
The van is approaching
across the street. Hurry.

477
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,097
DAEHAN TAEKWONDO

478
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,825
What?

479
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,912
Carter is heading towards the bus
with Ha-na!

480
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,581
Carter. Where are you going?

481
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,708
Follow my instructions.

482
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,419
I'm detecting the movements
of CIA agents nearby.

483
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,506
Carter! Why are you getting on a bus
all of a sudden?

484
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,843
Get off the bus!
Listen to my instructions. Carter!

485
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,846
I think the CIA has
caught on to your van.

486
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,849
If you don't follow my
orders, you and your daughter will both-

487
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,277
I've blocked the signal
to the device in your ear, Mich...

488
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,403
Agent Bane.

489
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,613
Why are you calling me Michael Bane?

490
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,157
It's time you tell me
who you really are.

491
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,119
Someone who knows you better
than that voice in your ear.

492
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,038
Yeah? What makes you so sure?

493
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,963
There was a time
where we faced life and death, together.

494
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,467
I'm on your side, Mike. I always was.

495
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,719
My side?

496
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,723
Your men just tried
to kill me back there.

497
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,894
And you expect me
to believe that you're on my side?

498
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,856
You really don't remember us?

499
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,485
I still see you...

500
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,239
In your eyes, I...

501
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,200
I just know you're still there.

502
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,246
I just know it's you.

503
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,418
Never mind.

504
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,130
It doesn't matter
if you remember me or not.

505
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,424
The DNA test will prove
that you're Michael Bane.

506
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,094
And until then, our agency
will continue to hunt you down.

507
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,306
You have to trust me
if you want to survive.

508
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,599
Yeah?

509
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,353
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

510
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,607
Fine. It's time you know
who they really are.

511
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,295
What's going on?
You still can't get a signal to Carter?

512
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,547
Someone's blocking
the communications channel.

513
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,865
First, let me identify the woman
who approached Carter.

514
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,010
The South is manipulating
the traffic lights.

515
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,078
The bus will stop 50 meters ahead
for one minute.

516
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,789
- Then we will be in range for the shot.
- Take her down.

517
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,893
We can identify her first,
there'll be time to take her out after.

518
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,043
Fire!

519
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,134
Run, Mike. Run before my men get here.

520
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,139
Hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry!

521
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,307
She got shot!

522
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,394
Call an ambulance!

523
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,591
Mister!

524
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,744
Hold on tight! Careful!

525
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,075
We all saw
the lab results! Hold your fire!

526
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,869
That's Michael Bane!

527
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,496
It doesn't matter who he is.
He's gone rogue.

528
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,706
We have to take him out.

529
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,291
It's not his fault.

530
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,836
He's just being used by the people
that are really pulling the strings.

531
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,130
Yeah, well, that puppet
is about to kill Paul!

532
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,048
Requesting permission to engage.

533
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,551
Please,
sir, don't do this.

534
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,386
Take the shot.

535
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,634
Mister, please help me!

536
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,761
Mister!

537
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,324
Use the bus, block him!

538
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,410
Hold your fire!
Checking DNA now.

539
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,329
Plan B. Surround him.

540
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,381
There is an emergency
military airstrip at the end of the road.

541
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,116
A plane is waiting there
to take you to North Korea.

542
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,559
My name is Kim Dong-gyu, Director
of North Korean Relations at the NIS.

543
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,103
I am responsible
for getting you to North Korea safely.

544
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,565
We opened a communications
channel in the South as well.

545
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,566
You've done well.

546
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,363
Hey, Jung Hee?

547
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,825
I don't think he trusts me.

548
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,787
Director Kim will be
ensuring your safety during the flight.

549
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,665
Come on. Let's board.

550
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,796
The reporters will hassle you.

551
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,215
Don't say a thing.

552
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,593
Don't look at them either.
Keep looking forward.

553
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,347
Even your slightest movement, Agent Lee,
may put this country

554
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,141
could put Dr. Jung and South Korea
in a dangerous spot.

555
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,039
Is it true that Ha-na's...

556
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,315
We'll be flying with US reporters.

557
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,234
Reporters will be on board?

558
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,820
Yes, that way,
the entire world will be watching us.

559
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,323
It'll keep the US government
from acting so reckless.

560
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,699
How did you find her?

561
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,869
Please cooperate, as this was a choice
to ensure our safe arrival.

562
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,289
Jung Ha-na, kidnapped
daughter of Dr. Jung Byeong-ho,

563
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,666
reappeared today.

564
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,876
Now, the South Korean government
gave no statement

565
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,294
regarding the kidnapping itself,

566
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,214
merely making a statement that reuniting
the doctor with his daughter

567
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,174
is of the utmost priority.

568
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,094
We will keep you updated
on further developments in this story,

569
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,639
which will hopefully result
in Ha-na's safe return to North Korea.

570
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,480
Hey now, you
shouldn't smoke with a child on board.

571
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,775
Hey, look,
there's no need to be so uptight.

572
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:36,406
You will be staying
here as we make our way to North Korea.

573
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,741
Here, this way.

574
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,790
Hey, you gotta be Ha-na.

575
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,292
Ha-na.

576
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,510
Come on, all right?

577
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,223
To start, you should both see our medic.

578
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,766
TREATMENT ROOM

579
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,228
Hello. Welcome.

580
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,239
If you'll remove that,
we can start the treatment.

581
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,413
You can take that seat.
The plane is taking off soon.

582
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,382
Excuse me,
we have an interview.

583
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,111
- After the treatment.
- Well, we'll do the interview later.

584
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,345
Sorry, later.

585
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:46,100
You both can change
once your injuries are mended.

586
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,644
Okay. Disinfect it.

587
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,566
Don't worry. It won't hurt anymore,
okay?

588
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,907
Mister, are you okay?

589
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,950
I'm okay.

590
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,245
Are you okay?

591
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,122
I'm okay too.

592
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,666
Hmm.

593
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,089
Why is your hand like that?

594
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,721
I can't remember.

595
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,308
I think I was with my daughter.

596
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,146
Well, um, aren't you remembering now?

597
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,401
When I see this scar on my hand,

598
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,529
it's as if I can hear a child crying.

599
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,284
Though, she might not
make it through today.

600
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,204
My daughter, that is.

601
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,291
What's your daughter's name?

602
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,086
Yoon Hee.

603
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,380
"Yoon Hee."

604
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,093
But I'm here, so it'll work out.

605
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,264
I'm the cure, right? A human cure.

606
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,686
All right, the treatment is done.

607
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,021
Excellent. Thank you.

608
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,442
All right. Why don't you put these on?

609
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,866
Ha-na, you should get changed as well,

610
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,034
after Mr. Carter is done.

611
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,873
Once you arrive in North Korea,
your mission will be finished.

612
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,042
I sincerely hope
that the cure is completed in time,

613
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,587
so that your child can be saved.

614
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,549
Was this mission really my choice?

615
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,510
So that I could save my daughter?

616
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,634
You'll get an answer
to that question

617
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,347
once your mission is complete.

618
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,516
Until then, don't let down your guard.

619
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,351
Remember this.

620
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:57,774
There may even be individuals
on this plane who are after Ha-na.

621
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,402
Didn't you say
that the US can't interfere anymore?

622
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,696
We have reason to believe

623
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,158
that the CIA may have ordered
other forces to move in on Ha-na.

624
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:11,245
It's possible North-Korean personnel may
be involved, wanting to start a coup.

625
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,082
The CIA contacting
the spy organization makes sense,

626
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,002
but what do you mean
by a coup within North Korea?

627
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,632
Well, we suspect
the virus may have been spread,

628
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,636
by those who want
the current regime to collapse.

629
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,434
Until Ha-na is safely reunited
with her father Dr. Jung,

630
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,062
don't trust anybody.

631
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,233
Don't even trust me.

632
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,033
- What's going on?
- Don't worry. I'll go investigate.

633
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,707
- What's going on?
- We've lost contact with the cockpit.

634
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,250
What?

635
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,134
- Director Kim, what's going on?
- Is there a problem?

636
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,885
Hurry, we need a medic!

637
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,890
What happened?

638
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,935
They both just collapsed.
But they just drank coffee.

639
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,565
Coffee?

640
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,651
Sir, I didn't do it.

641
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,529
Look, I brought the coffee
but that was it.

642
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,506
No,
you can't! Who else can fly the plane?

643
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,758
Look at his bloodshot eyes.

644
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:51,137
This plane's going down in ten minutes
if it's a mutated variant.

645
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,848
What do you think you're doing?

646
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,727
Director Kim tried to kill Comrade
Pilot and Comrade Assistant Pilot.

647
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,606
If we don't kill them, we will all die!

648
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,190
Everyone, calm down.

649
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,151
First we'll confirm they're infected.

650
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,234
Medic!

651
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,630
How does it look?

652
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,130
Technically,

653
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,510
in normal situations, this level
wouldn't be considered high enough,

654
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,930
but considering
the altitude and cabin pressure,

655
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,598
technically, this is an infection.

656
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,808
So, are they infected or not?

657
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,102
Give us more time to observe it.

658
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,356
At least give us five minutes
to get a proper reading.

659
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,900
What's the difference
in killing them now or then?

660
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,196
Hang on. But his hair roots are strong.

661
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,782
Don't you know it's too late
once the hair starts falling out?

662
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,576
The protocol states that
reading times are to be observed.

663
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,746
If anything happens in the meantime,
they will instantly be shot.

664
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,251
Open the blinds in the cabin!

665
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,712
The blinds, they aren't working.

666
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,092
Why is the medical room
emergency lights off?

667
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,761
Out of my way.

668
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,555
- Move!
- Director Kim!

669
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,516
Director Kim, what's the situation?

670
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,768
Due to what felt like
extreme turbulence,

671
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,062
we appear to have lost power on board.

672
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,772
Now, that is an extremely...

673
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,150
Carter.
Only you can hear what I'm saying.

674
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,278
In the cargo compartment,
I am sensing the heat signatures

675
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
of what appear to be an adult and Ha-na.

676
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,701
- The cargo compartment?
- You need to head there.

677
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,179
- Let's go.
- This is why South Korean bastards...

678
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,806
- You can never trust them.
- Ha-na!

679
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,706
CARGO COMPARTMENT

680
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,294
CABIN

681
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,522
Ha-na. Are you okay? Who did this?

682
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,529
Why are you doing this?

683
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,366
Your eyes really say
that you don't remember anything.

684
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,037
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

685
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,913
If you don't remember anything,

686
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,167
at least you'll be at peace
when you die, right?

687
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,511
Carter.

688
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,599
Director Kim.

689
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,185
Why... Why are you doing this?

690
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,854
Ri Cheol Ju, you son of a bitch!

691
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,231
Ha-na, are you all right?

692
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,816
- Yes.
- Don't move!

693
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:55,279
Who is it?
Who's the head of the North Korean coup?

694
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,866
Who spread this virus? Who created it!?

695
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,872
Do you really think North Korea would
make this mess just to die

696
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,084
and when we don't
even have a vaccine yet?

697
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,712
But have you considered that maybe,

698
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:16,467
it's the South that wanted the coup?

699
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,387
I guess you,

700
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,600
are just another facet of this
to make it more interesting.

701
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:27,686
Now that's enough of your bullshit.
Just answer me.

702
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,770
Who is it?

703
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,522
Lee Dong Jin?

704
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:31,856
Han Seol Ho?

705
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,274
Kim Jong Hyeok?

706
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:38,906
Director Kim.

707
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,575
You're embarrassing yourself,

708
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,831
You believe those stereotypes, huh?
You think I have loyalty to the North?

709
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,460
What, 'cause I'm from North Korea?
Is that it then?

710
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,379
What?

711
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,259
Do you think there's only one spy
like him in the North?

712
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,303
Ri Cheol Ju, you asshole!

713
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,472
Are you working with the United States?

714
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,021
Listen carefully.

715
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,107
Up there in the North,

716
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,528
the people call South Korea
an American colony.

717
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,572
The thing is,

718
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,325
after having met these Americans,

719
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,579
it looks like being on their side,

720
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,665
is more than worth it for me.

721
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,083
America.

722
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,545
Its freedom and equality.

723
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,591
A place with wealth
and all its opportunity.

724
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,596
Considering all of that!

725
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,098
Even if I live one day!

726
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,934
I'll live free, like a human!

727
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,187
Do you get that, Director?

728
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,732
Do you?

729
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,734
Die, you son of a bitch!

730
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,135
Ha-na, get out of here.

731
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,970
Mister.

732
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,597
Run fast and get help.

733
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,933
Hurry up! Be quick!

734
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,151
- What's going on here?
- Huh?

735
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,593
Wasn't that an explosion?

736
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,304
- The cockpit door won't open.
- What?

737
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,388
Ha-na!

738
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,184
- Ha-na. You all right?
- Why were you in there?

739
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,353
Have you been down
there this whole time?

740
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,106
What were you doing in there?

741
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,358
Hey, wait a sec.

742
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,736
Director Kim went
that way. Was he there?

743
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,658
He's dead.

744
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,287
The North Korean guy...

745
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,457
he killed Mr. Kim.

746
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,757
What's going on? What are you people
trying to pull over here?

747
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,386
We... We don't know anything!

748
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,431
Who was it? Who killed Director Kim?

749
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,058
Could you recognize their face?

750
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,104
It's okay.

751
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,443
It was that man!

752
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,699
Did you kill Director Kim? Huh?

753
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,452
Answer the question!

754
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,836
Yes, I did.

755
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,171
It was me.

756
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:28,761
Listen, Director Kim was just a CIA spy
that was planted here.

757
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,847
He was trying to take Ha-na away.

758
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,225
So I did it. I killed him.

759
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,605
I knew those South Korean bastards
would do this!

760
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,191
They're working with the CIA.
Those bastards!

761
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,114
Are you really going to listen
to this bastard?

762
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,987
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa! Calm down, okay?
Put the guns away for a second.

763
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,074
You can't just accept
whatever this guy is trying to say.

764
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,617
Ask Ha-na.

765
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,369
Is that true, Ha-na?

766
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,538
Did Director Kim take you?

767
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,530
Oh, yes, Comrade Sun Hwa.

768
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:30,864
Are you all right?

769
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,744
How are the pilot
and the co-pilot doing?

770
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,498
They are...

771
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,667
doing just fine.

772
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:59,351
He's choking her. One of
the North Koreans is choking Ha-na.

773
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,442
He's... He's covering
himself in her blood.

774
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,562
It's Ha-na's blood.

775
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,116
The infected aren't attacking him
because of her blood.

776
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,387
Ah! This is so exciting.

777
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,849
Hey. Look at you trying to survive.

778
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,435
This is some thrill, huh?

779
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:26,396
Looks like the people's hero,

780
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,149
is just a human when faced with death.

781
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:32,653
Get ready!

782
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,738
Moving to an estimated landing point

783
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,823
at 40 degrees latitude
and 124 degrees longitude.

784
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,700
- Ha-na, are you all right?
- Yes.

785
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,761
Kill the man
and catch the girl alive!

786
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,769
Somebody is on my tail!

787
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,413
They're
probably working with Ri Cheol Ju.

788
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,402
Carter!
Carter, are you all right?

789
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:02,070
Answer me. Carter!

790
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,968
Ha-na, grab the steering wheel! Go!

791
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,051
Okay.

792
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,887
Shoot the wheel!

793
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,703
Shit!

794
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,621
I'm out of bullets!

795
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,175
Move the car closer! Faster! More! More!

796
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:06,940
Where do I go now?

797
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,348
If you follow the valley down
about 20 meters,

798
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,028
there's a cliff and a rope bridge.

799
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,406
We are moving
to the opposite side now too.

800
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:17,367
The mission will be complete
once you get there.

801
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,494
Mister.

802
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:22,997
Here.

803
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,171
Let's go.

804
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,567
- Be careful, it's slippery.
- Okay.

805
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,434
Here. Get on my back.

806
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:50,687
I can go on my own.

807
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,698
Hug my neck
and clasp your hands together!

808
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,492
Don't ever let go!

809
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,577
Okay.

810
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:36,686
Carter!

811
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:44,610
Are you okay?

812
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:46,654
Are you Han Jung Hee?

813
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,910
Ha-na, are you okay?

814
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,371
So you're Ha-na. You've done a lot.

815
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,210
Thank you for your hard work.
Now we can leave together.

816
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,590
What exactly are you saying?
Leave together?

817
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,361
This is simply incredible.

818
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,654
A job well done.

819
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,492
It's a surprise
that you would love a woman

820
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,327
and a daughter that you two had

821
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:38,247
while you were working undercover. Hmm?

822
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:46,631
And I applaud you
for putting your life at risk,

823
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,966
to protect your own daughter.

824
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,139
Who are you, huh?

825
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,640
Oh.

826
01:29:58,518 --> 01:29:59,936
I'm Kim Jong Hyeok.

827
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,858
You know, seeing what you're capable of,

828
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,362
you sure don't seem
like you lost your memory.

829
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,578
Stop laughing. I want my memory back.

830
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:34,220
Go on. Sit down.

831
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:37,265
Once the device implanted
in your ear is removed,

832
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:38,808
you'll get your memory back.

833
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,069
Trust me. Okay?

834
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,894
I'm going to open
the stitches. This will hurt a bit.

835
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,314
Mister!

836
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:29,192
What's going on? Lieutenant General!

837
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:31,152
Get up!

838
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,446
- Carter!
- Mister!

839
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:35,656
Mister!

840
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,784
Where are you taking Carter? Tell me.

841
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,328
Look here, Han Jung Hee.

842
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:43,289
Don't make a scene. And stand down.

843
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:45,374
But you made us a promise!

844
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:50,046
We could leave this country
after Carter had finished the mission.

845
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,924
That deal was between you and the party.

846
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,260
I have never made such a promise.

847
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,847
Then what does that mean?

848
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,100
Put her in the car.

849
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,315
Let go of me. Let go!

850
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:11,400
Let go!

851
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:27,375
What do you think you're doing with me?

852
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:34,006
Love.

853
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,344
I always feel sad when I hear that word.

854
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,807
What is it to be so cruel?

855
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,144
Who knew that comrade Han Jung Hee,

856
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,772
the most competent
female comrade in the North,

857
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:54,110
could now find herself struggling
down in the gutter?

858
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:55,735
Huh?

859
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:58,447
Look, just make your point.

860
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:05,955
I knew it from the first moment,
the virus spread.

861
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:09,667
This completely rotten country,

862
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,920
all those pricks in South Korea
who only think about money,

863
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:17,425
and even those arrogant
American imperialist bastards,

864
01:33:18,634 --> 01:33:20,970
can be destroyed in one strike.

865
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:25,850
It's a once in a lifetime chance
from the heavens.

866
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:30,186
Wait, are you

867
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,524
the head of the coup in the North?

868
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:35,526
Comrade Han.

869
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,777
Listen to me.

870
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:39,614
Let's create a new world together.

871
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,672
Hey, the bastard's awake.

872
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:05,473
You American traitor.

873
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:07,433
So you're finally awake.

874
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,185
Where are you taking me?

875
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:12,855
Just keep quiet,
and your wife will make the decision.

876
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:14,982
My wife?

877
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,527
If you had never shown up here,

878
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:22,365
then the Comrade First Lieutenant Han
who I once loved

879
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,992
just might have been my wife.

880
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:31,289
Go on.

881
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:45,888
Get out.

882
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,316
Move it, pal. What are you looking at?

883
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,886
Enjoy that breath. It'll be your last.

884
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:27,429
Who knows, huh?

885
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,059
You might walk away a North Korean hero
and ex spy agent,

886
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,146
or you might become
barbecue in this fire.

887
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,940
Don't worry though,
it'll be decided soon.

888
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:39,691
Comrade hero,

889
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,862
if you've been good to your wife,
you might live.

890
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,260
Please let me live.

891
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,141
Pick up the phone.

892
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:02,525
Put it on speaker.

893
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,196
Yeah.

894
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:08,799
Where is Carter?

895
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,909
Waiting to be thrown
into the pit.

896
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:15,246
- What's the order?
- Wait a bit longer.

897
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:16,997
Yes, sir.

898
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,335
Kim Jong Hyeok, tell me where he is.

899
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:27,174
He's at, uh, the Sinuiju
Chemical Factory's biochemical facilities

900
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,969
about 1.5 kilometers to the north..

901
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:58,117
I'M GOING TO CALL YOU
KEEP ME ON THE PHONE - CARTER

902
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:16,552
You look like
you still haven't decided.

903
01:40:17,636 --> 01:40:19,096
Don't overthink it.

904
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:29,064
You need to save your family,

905
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,651
Carter, yourself, and your daughter.

906
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:35,904
I can guarantee their safety.

907
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,075
Let us go, like the party had promised.

908
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,537
I don't care what you do here,

909
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,206
what you do with North Korea.

910
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,294
Well, maybe you should care.

911
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,130
For instance,

912
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,758
if you two work with the Americans

913
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:59,053
and were to say all sorts of bullshit
to the entire world,

914
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,638
how will I look?

915
01:41:04,516 --> 01:41:06,518
I'll most likely get furious

916
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,772
and drag you all here again

917
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:15,235
to bury you all deep within
that anthrax incinerator.

918
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,406
But then again...

919
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,368
...if Carter Lee,
who saved the North from the virus,

920
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:26,038
were to stand with me and my men,

921
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,625
your husband will become a new idol

922
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,419
in uniting all of North Korea.

923
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:35,672
Idol, huh?

924
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,513
You just want a puppet, don't you,
who will do as you please?

925
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:47,726
Look, if it means he survives
then being a puppet is a small price.

926
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:49,478
Am I wrong?

927
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:53,607
Lieutenant General.

928
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:00,239
As I'm looking at you, threatening me
that you'll kill my husband,

929
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,200
I'm not seeing

930
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,035
any new world

931
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,122
for the North Korean people.

932
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:17,297
I was certain you'd
been blinded by a man,

933
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:22,177
but you've been blinded
to your immediate future as well.

934
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,107
I can't plan the future

935
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:38,902
of the People's Republic

936
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:42,114
with someone who's as blind as you are.

937
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,060
Shoot him!

938
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,669
Get down!

939
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,800
This is the room. Yoon Hee is in here.

940
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,226
- Where is she?
- Huh? No, where is she?

941
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,311
This has to be the right room.

942
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:01,610
No, don't!

943
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:03,904
- This child...
- She's our daughter!

944
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:06,114
She's our daughter?

945
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,367
Carter!

946
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:27,635
Mister!

947
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:29,179
Ha-na.

948
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:34,476
It's all right.

949
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:36,353
These people are just researchers.

950
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,522
Doctor, our daughter...

951
01:44:43,902 --> 01:44:45,779
You've been infected as well.

952
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:48,323
The child will be conscious
in about half an hour.

953
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:05,507
We need to get out of here, now.

954
01:45:28,947 --> 01:45:32,326
Please save my Ha-na.
The door is locked.

955
01:46:27,964 --> 01:46:29,466
Ha-na, it's me.

956
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,136
Ha-na. Ha-na, let's go.

957
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:54,408
Go into the closet
in front of you.

958
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:39,578
Give her to me.

959
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:28,043
Seven minutes ago, a train operated
by the... the Chinese government

960
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:31,004
left Ryung Gye for Dandong,
carrying the infected.

961
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:34,311
Not even the North Korean government
can interfere with that train,

962
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,468
so we need to stop it.

963
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:40,138
But we need to get
your memory back first.

964
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,348
Doctor.

965
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:44,893
If you open his stitches,
you'll see a device.

966
01:48:44,976 --> 01:48:47,646
If you plug this into it,
his memories will return.

967
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,236
"BD-7."

968
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:36,629
- Do you think it is wise for...
- Yoon Hee!

969
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,798
- Dad...
- I'll get Ha-na to the North.

970
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,699
Dr. Jung is with me at the moment.

971
01:49:40,782 --> 01:49:42,367
Yoon Hee's been infected.

972
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:45,579
Just a bit longer. We're almost there.

973
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:49,666
Jung Hee!

974
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:10,020
The country is falling into ruins
because of the virus.

975
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:14,232
So do you think it wise
that our Comrade hero of the Republic

976
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:17,235
is abandoning the country
during a time such as this?

977
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,405
Let us go. I beg you.

978
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:23,283
Lieutenant General, please.

979
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:25,243
Just let us go, please.

980
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,164
So you still haven't come
to your senses, Comrade.

981
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:31,625
Have you forgotten

982
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:35,211
that having your child
was the party's decision?

983
01:50:37,255 --> 01:50:38,882
Please tell your superiors

984
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:43,261
if you... if you swear
to release our family,

985
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,930
I'll get Ha-na to the North.

986
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:48,975
Do you know what you've said?

987
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:50,685
What it will do

988
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,439
to you, your daughter, and your wife?

989
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:59,110
No one knows specifically
if the CIA moved Ha-na out already,

990
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:02,989
or if she's still hidden somewhere
in South Korea.

991
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:07,410
I can find her if I become bait
and approach the CIA on my own.

992
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:10,455
I don't side with the North or America,

993
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:12,624
so it won't be an
international conflict.

994
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:18,880
How can I trust you'll do it though,

995
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:23,051
an agent who got plastic surgery

996
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,262
to spy for seven years?

997
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:30,809
If you run, and abandon
your wife and your daughter,

998
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:36,272
that will only mean exposure
of our entire operation.

999
01:51:39,275 --> 01:51:40,275
Then, um...

1000
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,364
BD-7 can erase everything that I know.

1001
01:51:46,282 --> 01:51:47,826
Use it and send me South.

1002
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:49,744
Carter.

1003
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:52,706
BD-7.

1004
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,501
How do you know that information?

1005
01:51:56,584 --> 01:51:58,336
Just give us this one chance.

1006
01:51:59,421 --> 01:52:01,589
And I'll get Ha-na
to the North, you'll see.

1007
01:52:03,007 --> 01:52:04,426
In exchange, you let us go.

1008
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:27,466
- Yoon Hee!
- No!

1009
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:28,658
- Yoon Hee!
- No!

1010
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,244
- Yoon Hee! Yoon Hee!
- Yoon Hee!

1011
01:52:32,871 --> 01:52:34,414
- Yoon Hee.
- Yoon Hee.

1012
01:52:34,497 --> 01:52:35,749
Comrade Carter.

1013
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:42,088
You must successfully
see this thing through.

1014
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,967
Because now...

1015
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:49,804
...Yoon Hee's been infected.

1016
01:52:50,764 --> 01:52:53,558
Yoon Hee. Yoon Hee.

1017
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:56,936
No.

1018
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,402
Yoon Hee.

1019
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:06,446
Oh, my baby.

1020
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:33,056
Have your memories come back?

1021
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:38,311
Do you... Do you remember us?

1022
01:53:42,774 --> 01:53:43,817
I'm sorry.

1023
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,777
I left you here.

1024
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:49,197
You went to save our family.

1025
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:51,031
And well...

1026
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:52,617
And you really did.

1027
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:05,839
Carter!

1028
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:09,676
Listen. Take the children first and run!

1029
01:54:17,892 --> 01:54:18,893
Ha-na, quickly.

1030
01:54:19,435 --> 01:54:21,896
If you move northwest,
you'll see a train coming in.

1031
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:23,500
Just hurry.

1032
01:54:26,818 --> 01:54:27,902
What about you though?

1033
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:29,737
Just worry about the children now.

1034
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,781
- Doctor. Hurry!
- Hold on, Ha-na!

1035
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:34,284
Ha-na, you have to hold on tight!

1036
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:36,995
Hide behind the car.

1037
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:11,112
Ha-na, hang on tight!

1038
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,591
DANDONG EMERGENCY MEDICAL COMMAND CENTER

1039
01:56:00,536 --> 01:56:03,039
Ha-na. Stay right here.

1040
01:58:12,251 --> 01:58:15,004
No! Get away from me!

1041
01:59:09,016 --> 01:59:10,101
Prepare to fire.

1042
02:01:29,782 --> 02:01:31,033
Go lower. Go lower!

1043
02:01:59,061 --> 02:02:01,105
Hang on, Ha-na! Ha-na!

1044
02:02:01,188 --> 02:02:03,024
Ha-na! Take my hand!

1045
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:19,433
You sneaky shit.

1046
02:03:21,018 --> 02:03:22,103
So,

1047
02:03:22,853 --> 02:03:25,356
you think those memories
you finally regained

1048
02:03:26,357 --> 02:03:28,943
are memories that are really yours?

1049
02:05:53,337 --> 02:05:55,839
Doctor, get on before me!

1050
02:06:58,068 --> 02:07:00,362
- Yoon Hee.
- Yoon Hee.

1051
02:07:10,372 --> 02:07:11,665
Yoon Hee, are you all right?

1052
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:13,751
Do you recognize me?

1053
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:16,253
M-Mom.

1054
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:18,756
Yes, it's me.

1055
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:23,260
Where are we going now?
